* The upload asset (CreateAsset) API is asynchronous. System processing may result in queuing, which can increase the time required for storage; higher latency is expected for uploading video.
* SLA for uploading time is not guaranteed.
* You must ensure that the uploaded virtual portrait meets the following conditions:
   * You legally own the asset and have full rights to use and dispose of it. The asset does not contain unauthorized third\-party trademarks or logo content.
   * The asset must not resemble any real human person's portrait, must not be plagiarized or misappropriated, and must not infringe upon any third party's personality rights, intellectual property rights, or other legal interests.
   * The asset does not contain content that violates regulations, contravenes public order and morals, or endangers national security.

:::
The Dreamina Seedance 2.0 (Seedance 2.0) models have comprehensive capabilities to prevent Deepfake and copyright infringement risks. When generating video, risky reference material input will be intercepted to maximize compliance and security of the generated video.
To ensure creators can fully leverage the powerful video generation capabilities of Seedance 2.0 to efficiently generate video content while avoiding potential risks of AI\-generated content, ModelArk has launched the private trusted asset library. Trusted assets that have been added to the library will enter your private asset library and be used in video generation.
The workflow for using the private asset library is as follows:
<span>![图片](https://p9-arcosite.byteimg.com/tos-cn-i-goo7wpa0wc/843a8c3f0c734fea93c699b39bdb8427~tplv-goo7wpa0wc-image.image =4372x) </span>
<span id="7597a0cd"></span>
# Structure of the asset library

* **Asset Group**: Each asset file is an Asset, and each Asset belongs to an Asset Group.
   * Asset groups allow flexible management of assets. For example, assets of the same person can be grouped together.
* **Asset:**  A file (image, video or audio) that is trusted by the Seedance 2.0 models for inference.

:::tip tip
**Caution**

* Only assets required for inference need to be added to the library; do not add assets that are not required.
* Only the Asset ID of assets already added to the library can be used for video generation; assets for the same character that are not added to the library cannot be used.
* Each uploaded asset must be preprocessed. You can poll the GetAsset API to check the asset status (the `Status` field). The asset can be used for subsequent inference only after the status becomes `Active`. If the status is `Failed`, preprocessing has failed and the asset cannot be used for inference. For details, see the code sample in [Example: Upload assets and use GetAsset to retrieve asset information ](/docs/ModelArk/2333565#28a8c5b5).

:::
Taking uploading character image asset as an example:
**Single image file format requirements:** 

* Format: jpeg, png, webp, bmp, tiff, gif, heic/heif
* Aspect ratio (width/height): (0.4, 2.5)
* Width and height (px): (300, 6000)
* Each image file must be less than 30 MB.

To ensure that the character's face, clothing details, and other features in the generated video are consistent with the uploaded asset, it is recommended to upload multiple assets of the same person into the same asset group according to the following rules and examples:

* **Best practices for portrait asset content:** 

:::tip tip
**Full\-body reference image requirements**

* Layout: Vertical
* Image content: Full\-body frontal image of the person

:::
<div style="text-align: center">

:::tip tip
**Facial close\-up image requirements**

* Layout: Vertical
* Image content: Frontal close\-up of the person without expression, above the shoulders, with the face occupying about two\-thirds of the frame

## Upload assets to the virtual portrait library (API & UI console)
You can upload your own virtual portraits to the private asset library.
:::tip tip
You must ensure that the uploaded virtual portrait meets the following conditions:

* You legally own the asset and have full rights to use and dispose of it. The asset does not contain any unauthorized third\-party trademarks or logo content.
* The asset must not resemble the portrait or likeness of any natural person, must not involve plagiarism or misappropriation, and must not infringe upon any third party's personality rights, intellectual property rights, or other legal rights and interests.
* The asset does not contain content that violates laws and regulations, public order and good morals, or endangers national security.

:::
ModelArk will conduct a security review of the assets you upload. Once approved, you can use the assets to generate video in the Experience Center and API.
You can use OpenAPI interfaces or upload assets in the Model Playground.

```


2. **Upload an asset**

Use the **POST** CreateAsset API to upload an asset.
:::tip tip
The CreateAsset API is asynchronous. Processing may be queued, which can increase ingestion time. Upload\-time SLAs are **not guaranteed**.
:::
Provide the following in the request:

* **GroupId**: Required. Asset group ID.
* **URL**: Required. Accessible image URL.
* **AssetType**: Required. Support uploading image/video/audio assets. You need to specify the asset type here: **Image/Video/Audio**. For specific restrictions on asset files, see the [Assets API documentation](https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/ModelArk/2318271) **.** 
* **Name**: Optional. Asset name, which can be used for asset management, such as the asset file name.

:::tip tip
This field is used only for fuzzy search when calling the \*\*\*\* ListAssets API and is not included in model inference. For details on generating videos with assets, see [Preset digital characters](/docs/ModelArk/2291680#2bf01416)[ ](https://bytedance.larkoffice.com/docx/U7zNdYouZokhuixUxQncAaIPnph#share-DqBwdIWREoA1y2x42Qvcd3dBnQb)and [3. How should I reference uploaded assets in the prompt (content.text)?](/docs/ModelArk/2333565#785eb71a)

:::
* **Moderation**: Optional. Specifies whether to turn off the Content Pre\-filter review for the current asset.
   * By default, the Content Pre\-filter review is on.
   * To skip most non\-baseline content security review policies, set this parameter to `"Moderation": { "Strategy": "Skip"}`

:::danger danger

* To ensure this setting takes effect, **first turn off the Secure Mode** on the asset management page ([Model Playground](https://console.byteplus.com/ark/region:ark+ap-southeast-1/experience/vision?modelId=dreamina-seedance-2-0-260128&tab=GenVideo)  **\> My assets \> Manage assets** or [Model activation](https://console.byteplus.com/ark/region:ark+ap-southeast-1/openManagement?LLM=%7B%7D&advancedActiveKey=model)  **\> Assets library**).
Otherwise, if the value is set to Skip, the API will return an error.
* **Please note the following impacts**:
   * **Console asset management will be permanently disabled.**  You will no longer be able to view or manage assets in the console. Assets can be managed **only via API**.
   * You will **no longer be able to authorize** real\-human portrait assets to other users.
   * This change applies to the **primary account and all sub\-accounts**. If you turn it off, it will be turned off for all.
   * This operation is **irreversible**. Once disabled, **Secure Mode** cannot be re\-enabled.
:::
* **ProjectName**: Optional. Specifies the resource project name. Defaults to **default**. Resources in a project can only be used by inference endpoints within that project. For more information about project, see the related [IAM docs](https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/byteplus-platform/docs-managing-projects).

:::tip tip
**Caution**
If **ProjectName** is not specified in the request, the asset will be uploaded to the **default** project by default. You need to use this field to ensure the asset is uploaded to the corresponding project.
:::
**Notes**:

* Each request uploads a single asset file.
* This request returns the asset ID. You can use the GetAsset API to view whether the upload was successful.

### Update/delete assets or asset group
For details, see: [Virtual portrait library API reference](/docs/ModelArk/2333601).

## Example: Upload assets and use GetAsset to retrieve asset information
The following example creates an asset, queries the asset Status, and determines whether to continue querying or back the corresponding result based on the status.
The code executes the following logic:

1. createAsset: Upload resources and obtain AssetId
2. waitForAssetActive: Start querying and repeatedly call getAssetStatus to check the current asset status
3. Determine based on Status
   * Processing → Continue polling
   * Active → Back URL (end). Once the status is **Active**, the asset Asset ID (in URI format) can be used for video generation.
   * Failed → Back error (end)
4. Return the result and print the output

&nbsp;
The query result is illustrated as follows:
```JSON
asset status: Active
asset is active, URL = 
asset is active, URL = https://ark-media-asset-ap-southeast-1.tos-ap-southeast-1.volces.com/300060****/03301616086559****.jpg?X-Tos-Algorithm=***********

<span id="5a7806b3"></span>
## Generate video using portrait assets
After obtaining the asset Asset ID, private portrait assets can be used to generate video.
For details, see [Preset digital characters](/docs/ModelArk/2291680#2bf01416).
Use the asset URI in the **content._url.url**field of the Video Generation API to generate video.
:::tip tip
Asset URI pattern: asset://<Asset_Id\*\*\>\*\*
tip
In the prompt you send to the model, reference assets using **type + index**, such as **Image 1** and **Video 1**. The index is the asset’s position in the request body.
**Do not** use an Asset ID directly in the prompt.
Example: “The girl in **Image 1** is wearing the outfit from **Image 2** and is arranging items on the counter. The boy in **Image 3** is a customer who walks up and asks the girl for her contact information.”
For a complete call example, see [3. How should I reference uploaded assets in the prompt (content.text)?](/docs/ModelArk/2333565#785eb71a)

## FAQs
<span id="8f894b5a"></span>
#### 1. Why is it not possible to generate video or retrieve asset information after assets are uploaded successfully?
The asset library is isolated by **Project (ProjectName)** .

* When generating video, inference must be performed using the inference endpoint in the **project where the asset resides**.
* If the asset upload is successful but retrieving the asset via the API fails, it may be because different **ProjectName** values were provided when calling the upload asset (CreateAsset) and retrieve asset APIs.
   * The default value for **ProjectName** is default. If this field is not specified, resources are created in the default project by default.
   * It is recommended to manage assets within the same project.

For more information about project, see the related [IAM docs](https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/byteplus-platform/docs-managing-projects).
:::tip tip
If **ProjectName** is not specified in the request, the asset group will be created in the **default** project by default.
:::
<span id="dbacdf1e"></span>
#### 2. How to manage user permissions for the asset library?
You can use [Access control](https://console.byteplus.com/iam/identitymanage/user) (IAM) to finely manage user actions in the asset library. Settings can be configured as follows:

1. **Create a custom policy**
   1. Open [Access control](https://console.byteplus.com/iam/policymanage) \> **Create policy**
   2. Input the policy name.
   3. Switch to the **JSON editor**, paste the custom policy below into the editor, and click **submit** to save.

<span>![图片](https://p9-arcosite.byteimg.com/tos-cn-i-goo7wpa0wc/aaa972e2485e4728b76ce685aca26c33~tplv-goo7wpa0wc-image.image =1645x) </span>
```Python

{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ark:*Asset*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```


2. **Grant permissions to users/user groups**
   1. Click **User management** \> **User**/**User group**, select the user or user group to grant permissions to, and click **Authorize.** 
   2. In **Policy**, select the policy created in **Step 1**.
   3. (Optional) In **Limit to project resources**, select the project to which the policy applies.
   4. Click **submit.** 

After completing the above actions, the user or user group can manage assets in the corresponding project.
For more information about IAM, please refer to the [IAM docs](https://docs.byteplus.com/en/docs/byteplus-platform/docs-overview-3).
<span id="785eb71a"></span>
#### 3. How should I reference uploaded assets in the prompt (`content.text`)?
In the prompt, reference assets using the format  **“asset type + index”** , for example: **Image 1**, **Video 1**, **Audio 1**. The index is the position of that asset within the same asset type in the request body.
**Note:**  Do not reference assets by **Asset ID** in the prompt.
For example, the sample below includes **five** reference images and **one** reference audio file. Use the prompt format in the example to reference these assets.

* **Prompt:** 

```Plain
Create a fresh, creamy-painting–style short drama with a light, upbeat guitar track driving quick beat cuts. Use a cream-white base with peach-pink highlights, soft lighting, no visual effects—emotion conveyed through expressions. 0–2s: Two fast cuts: the CEO from Image 1 accidentally bumps into the female lead wearing the outfit from Image 2 (character from Image 3); they freeze and lock eyes, then a hand close-up as the CEO pulls off his suit jacket and drapes it over her shoulders. Gentle guitar starts; soft SFX of a coffee cup dropping and fabric brushing. 2–6s: Three fast cuts: the female lead, wrapped in his jacket, looks down and smiles shyly (cheeks flushed, close-up); the CEO watches her back with a faint smile and says “我们一起走吧,” voice style referenced from Audio 1 (profile shot); the two share a black umbrella in the rain, fingertips touch then quickly pull back (near shot). Rainy backdrop references Image 4; each cut hits a light drum accent with rain and umbrella SFX, a subtle soft-mist look. 6–8s: Slow-motion eye-contact smiles; the text portion from Image 5 appears at the lower right, with small text “NEW EP DAILY” at the lower left. Minimal pale-pink petals drift; the guitar resolves gently as the frame freezes on their side-by-side profiles.
